@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Eqn.\ \ref {eq:pen} may appear related to the {\protect \em  weight of evidence} \cite {Good1984}. The two quantities, however, are fundamentally different, both mathematically and conceptually. A requirement of weight of evidence is that the posterior probability should be recoverable provided probability of the evidence alone; i.e., $P(C|E)$ should be derivable from $\rho _{EC}$ and $P(E)$ if $\rho _{EC}$ can be considered weight of evidence as Good describes (see Eqn.\ (2) of \cite {Good1984}). This requirement is not met by the penchant, as the probability of the cause, $P(C)$, is also required to derive the posterior. The intended scope of the penchant is also much more restricted than that of the weight of evidence. Most of the examples presented by Good in \cite {Good1984} cannot be addressed directly with any times series causality tools."}
