@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Eqn.\ \ref {eq:pen} may appear related to the {\protect \em  weight of evidence} \cite {Good1984}. The two quantities, however, are fundamentally different, both mathematically and conceptually. A requirement of weight of evidence is that the posterior probability should be recoverable provided probability of the evidence alone; i.e., $P(C|E)$ should be derivable from $\rho _{EC}$ and $P(E)$ if $\rho _{EC}$ can be considered weight of evidence as Good describes (see Eqn.\ (2) of \cite {Good1984}). This requirement is not met by the penchant, as the probability of the cause, $P(C)$, is also required to derive the posterior. The intended scope of the penchant is also much more restricted than that of the weight of evidence. Most of the examples presented by Good in \cite {Good1984} cannot be addressed directly with any times series causality tools. Eqn.\ \ref {eq:pen} is, however, identical in form to the {\protect \em  Eells measure of causal strength} (also called the {\protect \em  probability contrast}) \cite {Illari2011}. Eqn.\ \ref {eq:pen} will not be used as a measure of causal strength in this work. Rather, it will be used as a measure indicative of driving without any concern for notions of the ``strength'' of such driving. As such, we will use the term {\protect \em  penchant} to avoid confusion. Also see \cite {kleinberg2012} for a discussion of similar expressions."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Sugihara et al.\ \cite {Sugihara2012} do not explore any of the numerous non-linear extenstions of Granger causality. The theoretical foundations of Granger causality are independent of its practical implementations, and failures of Granger causality may be failures of a specific implementation, e.g., using linear forecast models with non-linear data \cite {Granger1980}."}
