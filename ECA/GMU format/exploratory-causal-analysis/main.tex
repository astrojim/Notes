\abstractpage
Many scientific disciplines rely on observational data of systems for which it is difficult (or impossible) to implement controlled experiments. For example, there is no current technology that can control the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetic field measured at the surface of Earth, so space weather studies rely on data collected without performing controlled experiments.  Causal inference with data sets from such systems is difficult.   The need to identify potential causal relationships with time series data has lead to the development of several different time series causality tools, including transfer entropy, pairwise asymmetric inference, causal leaning, and Granger causality statistics.  This work introduces the concept of exploratory causal analysis, and explores the use of time series causality tools in performing this analysis.  Given a pair of time series, can any statements be made about one potentially driving the other (for some notion of ``driving'')?
