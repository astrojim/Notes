@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Currently, there are no published equivalence conditions for CCM to either transfer entropy or Granger causality."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="This definition differs slightly from the definition in \cite {Sugihara2012}, which uses the un-squared Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. We use the square of this value to avoid dealing with negative correlation values. This subtle change in the definition does not affect the conclusions drawn in \cite {Sugihara2012}, as can be seen in our reproduction of key plots from that work: Figure \ref {fig:BGridPlot} and Figure \ref {fig:Sug3CDredo}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="In terms of $\Delta $, convergence to a value $\kappa $ means $\protect \qopname  \relax m{lim}_{L\rightarrow \infty }|\Delta -\kappa | = 0$. As the ``estimation skill'' of the CCM algorithm increases, each of the CCM correlations, $C_{XY}$ and $C_{YX}$, converge to some fixed value. Thus, $\Delta $ converges to some fixed value $\kappa $. $\Delta $ depends on the library length $L$ because the CCM algorithm depends on $L$. However, the complicated algorithmic dependence makes formally solving this limit difficult. As such, convergence is determined from plots, following the method used in \cite {Sugihara2012}."}
