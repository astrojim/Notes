@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="This definition differs slightly from the original definition in \cite {Sugihara2012}, which just uses Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. We use the square of this value to avoid dealing with negative correlation values. This subtle change in the definition does not affect the conclusions drawn in \cite {Sugihara2012}, as can be seen in our reproduction of key plots from that work: Figure \ref {fig:BGridPlot} and Figure \ref {fig:Sug3CDredo}."}
